Hi Hiring Team at SatSure,

Thank you for considering my profile for this assignment.

Despite a busy schedule, I was able to complete the assignment to the best of my ability. Although we can implement the setup, time constraints limited what I could present.

This repository consists of two branches:

infra: This branch contains the Terraform code to create a virtual machine on Azure Cloud and install Minikube on the VM.
grafana: This branch contains the code for Grafana.
To implement this, we need to set up the environment accordingly.

Please review the code and let me know if we can connect.
